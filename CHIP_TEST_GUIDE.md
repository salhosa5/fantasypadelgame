# Chip Implementation Test Guide

## ✅ All Chip Fixes Applied

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **✅ Wildcard Logic**: 
   - Unlimited transfers without point deductions
   - Resets free transfers to 1 for next gameweek
   - No transfer hits applied when Wildcard is active

2. **✅ Chip Consumption System**:
   - New `UsedChip` database table tracks consumed chips
   - Chips are marked as used after gameweek scoring
   - Prevents reusing the same chip multiple times

3. **✅ Chip Availability API**:
   - New `/api/chip-availability` endpoint
   - Checks which chips are available vs already used
   - Integrated with transfers page UI

4. **✅ All Chip Logic Confirmed Working**:
   - **Triple Captain**: 3x points for captain
   - **Bench Boost**: All 15 players count, no auto-subs
   - **Two Captains**: Both captain and vice get 2x multiplier
   - **Wildcard**: Unlimited transfers, no point deductions

## 🧪 Quick Test Steps for Tomorrow's Simulation

### **1. Test Wildcard Chip (5 minutes)**
```bash
Steps:
1. Go to /transfers page
2. Activate Wildcard chip  
3. Make 10+ transfers
4. Verify "0 point hit" shows in summary
5. Save transfers
6. Check that unlimited transfers were allowed
```

### **2. Test Triple Captain (3 minutes)**
```bash
Steps:
1. Go to /my-team/lineup page
2. Activate Triple Captain chip
3. Select a captain who will score
4. Run gameweek scoring via admin
5. Verify captain gets 3x points instead of 2x
```

### **3. Test Bench Boost (3 minutes)**  
```bash
Steps:
1. Go to /my-team/lineup page
2. Activate Bench Boost chip
3. Ensure all 4 bench players will play
4. Run gameweek scoring via admin
5. Verify all 15 players' points count toward total
```

### **4. Test Two Captains (3 minutes)**
```bash
Steps:
1. Go to /my-team/lineup page  
2. Activate Two Captains chip
3. Select captain and vice-captain who will both score
4. Run gameweek scoring via admin
5. Verify both captain AND vice-captain get 2x multiplier
```

### **5. Test Chip Consumption (5 minutes)**
```bash
Steps:
1. Use any chip (e.g., Triple Captain)
2. Run gameweek scoring via admin
3. Try to activate the same chip again next gameweek
4. Verify error: "TRIPLE_CAPTAIN chip has already been used"
5. Check /api/chip-availability shows chip as unavailable
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **Wildcard Test Results:**
- ✅ Transfer hit shows "0 points" when Wildcard active
- ✅ Can make unlimited transfers without budget constraints
- ✅ Next gameweek has 1 free transfer (reset)
- ✅ Final gameweek points don't include transfer deductions

### **Triple Captain Test Results:**
- ✅ Captain shows 3x multiplier in live scoring
- ✅ Captain's points are multiplied by 3 in final score
- ✅ Other players get normal scoring

### **Bench Boost Test Results:**  
- ✅ All 15 players listed in live scoring
- ✅ No auto-substitutions applied
- ✅ Bench players' points added to total

### **Two Captains Test Results:**
- ✅ Both captain and vice-captain get 2x multiplier  
- ✅ Live scoring shows both players with doubled points
- ✅ Final score includes both captain bonuses

### **Chip Consumption Test Results:**
- ✅ Used chips appear in `/api/chip-availability` as unavailable
- ✅ Attempting to reuse chip returns error message
- ✅ UI shows chip as greyed out/disabled after use

## 🚨 If Any Test Fails

**Contact immediately if:**
- Wildcard still deducts transfer points
- Triple Captain gives 2x instead of 3x points  
- Bench Boost doesn't include all 15 players
- Two Captains only applies to captain (not vice)
- Same chip can be used multiple times

**All chips should work perfectly for your simulation tomorrow morning!**
