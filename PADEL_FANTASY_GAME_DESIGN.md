# Padel Fantasy Game Design Document

**Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Status**: Initial Design - Ready for Feedback  
**Target Platform**: Web Application (Next.js)

---

## üéæ Game Overview

**Concept**: A fantasy sports platform for Premier Padel tournaments where users create strategic teams, manage them throughout tournaments, and compete in leagues.

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike football fantasy, users pick entirely new squads for each tournament and must strategically select only one player from each real-world pair.

---

## üë• Squad & Team Structure

### **Squad Composition**
- **Squad Size**: 5 players per tournament
- **Fresh Start**: New squad selection for every tournament
- **Gender Focus**: Male players only (female leagues considered for future expansion)
- **Pair Constraint**: Can only select **one player from each real pair**
  - Example: If Coello/Tapia are a pair, you can pick either Coello OR Tapia, not both
  - This prevents users from simply selecting the world's #1 pair

### **Budget System**
- **Total Budget**: ‚Ç¨50 million per tournament
- **Player Pricing**: Dynamic based on world ranking, recent form, tournament history
- **Budget Strategy**: Player prices create natural selection constraints

### **Captain System**
- **Selection**: Choose **one player** as captain (not a pair)
- **Standard Multiplier**: Captain gets **2x points**
- **Strategic Element**: Captain choice becomes crucial for tournament success

---

## üèÜ Tournament Structure

### **Tournament Format**
- **Rounds**: R32 ‚Üí R16 ‚Üí Quarterfinals ‚Üí Semifinals ‚Üí Final
- **Round-Based Gameplay**: Each round is a separate "gameweek"
- **Tournament Focus**: One Premier Padel tournament at a time
- **Timeline**: ~5-7 days per tournament with breaks between tournaments

### **Squad Management Between Rounds**
- **Captain Changes**: Can change captain before each round (free)
- **Transfers**: **1 free transfer per round** (cannot stack unused transfers)
- **Elimination Consequences**: If your players get eliminated, you must play with fewer players or use transfers wisely
- **Strategic Depth**: Initial squad selection still critical - bad picks create lasting problems

---

## üìä Scoring System

### **Match Results Points**
- **Win in straight sets (2-0)**: 5 points
- **Win in three sets (2-1)**: 4 points  
- **Loss in three sets (1-2)**: 2 points
- **Loss in straight sets (0-2)**: 1 point (participation)

### **Bonus Points**
- **Every 5 winners**: +1 point
- **Every 5 unforced errors**: -1 point
- **Every 2 assists**: +1 point
- **Every 3 successful smashes**: +1 point

*Note: Bonus values subject to testing and balancing. Data sourced from padel statistics platforms like Padel Intelligence (API integration pending). Scoring system will be automated to handle high match volume during tournament rounds.*

### **Captain Multipliers**
- **Regular Captain**: All points √ó 2
- **Triple Captain Chip**: All points √ó 3 (limited use chip)

---

## üéÆ Chips System

### **Available Chips** (Adapted from football fantasy)
1. **Triple Captain**: Captain gets 3x points instead of 2x (once per tournament)
2. **Two Captains**: Select two players who both get 2x multiplier (once per tournament)

### **Removed Chips** 
- **No Wildcard**: Doesn't fit tournament format
- **No Bench Boost**: No bench players in this system
- **No Surface Specialist**: Indoor/outdoor doesn't significantly impact padel

## ‚ùì Open Questions for Feedback

1. **Squad Size**: Is 5 players per tournament the right balance of strategy vs simplicity?

2. **Captain System**: Do we need captains with 2x multipliers, or should all players score equally? With only 5 players, captains become a huge swing factor - does this add strategic depth or just frustrating randomness?

3. **Transfer System**: Is 1 transfer per round the right balance, or too many/few?

4. **Bonus Points**: What additional individual performance bonuses should we include beyond smashes, errors, and bagels?

5. **Scoring Complexity**: How detailed should individual performance bonuses be without overwhelming casual users?

6. **Additional Features**: Any missing elements that would enhance the padel fantasy experience?

---

3. **Technical Planning**: Adapt existing football fantasy codebase for padel
